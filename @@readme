proj1 is htable
proj2 is bst

 elem files need to be updated to define your el_t

 htable or bst files need to be updated

 So, you must first copy here:
  elem* from ../forHW8 
  llist* from ../forHW8  if using htable
  slist* from ../forHW8  if using htable
 and
  htable* from ../forHW8  or
  binstree* from ../forHW4

You should know how to do that because you have
copied files using cp for previous homework.

GOAL:
AFTER all the changes to htable and binstree
HW8 and HW4 clients should still work
meaning that they should not be dependent on a particular el_t
or file names.
