# Library Database Project
## Project Structure
#### In this project I used a hash function using a book's ISBN as the key. An element object is created for each book detailing specific facts of the book as follows:
1. Book ISBN
2. Title
3. Author
4. Rating
5. Genre
6. Series?
7. Available?

## Project Structure
#### Once the program is run users can choose from a list of items to perform on the book object.
1. Load the data file.
2. Display the data on the screen
3. Search using ISBN as the key
4. Delete a Book
5. Save the data to a file
6. Exit
